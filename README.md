# Decision Tree – Student Result Prediction

This project implements a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a student will **Pass or Fail** based on attendance, study hours, and internal marks using Python and scikit-learn.

---

## 📌 Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts student results using a Decision Tree algorithm.

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Splitting Criterion: **Entropy (Information Gain)**

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
A small sample dataset is created manually with the following features:

| Feature | Description |
|-------|------------|
| Attendance | Student attendance level (High / Low) |
| Study_Hours | Whether the student studies regularly (Yes / No) |
| Internal_Marks | Internal assessment performance (Good / Poor) |
| Result | Final result (Pass / Fail) |
